# ryanfurrer-v4
This iteration of my portfolio was a big step forward for me. It was still built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, but it was the most polished website of mine at the time. Between the design, the code, the focus on SEO, and more. I tried new things such as a proper theme changer, using "tabs" to display a selectrion of my projects, and the website being more than a single-page project. I am still quite proud of this website despite having moved onto [ryanfurrer-v5](https://github.com/ryanfurrer/ryanfurrer-v5).
